- **Default Provider**: DeepSeek for optimal performance and cost efficiency
- **Intelligent Chunking**: Handles extremely large documents up to 400K words with token-aware processing
- **Temperature Control**: Configurable temperature settings for consistent grading
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains assignment context across large document chunks

## Document Processing Pipeline
- **Multi-Format Support**: PDF, DOCX, images with automatic text extraction
- **Mathematical Content**: KaTeX rendering and MathPix OCR integration for mathematical notation
- **AI Detection**: GPTZero integration for detecting AI-generated content
- **Smart Parsing**: Automatic student name detection and content formatting

## Grading Engine
- **Adaptive Grading**: Multiple depth levels (short, medium, long) for different feedback needs
- **Grade Level Aware**: Customizable feedback based on academic level (K-12 through PhD)
- **Chart Generation**: Automatic performance visualization and analytics
- **Professor Feedback Loop**: Iterative improvement system based on instructor input

## Communication System
- **Email Integration**: SendGrid for automated feedback delivery
- **Real-time Chat**: AI-powered chat interface for assignment discussions
- **PDF Export**: Professional report generation for grading results

# Data Flow

1. **Assignment Creation**: Professors create assignments with prompts and grading rubrics
2. **Submission Processing**: Student submissions are uploaded and processed through document extraction pipeline
3. **AI Analysis**: Content is analyzed for AI detection and then sent to selected LLM provider
4. **Intelligent Chunking**: Large submissions are automatically chunked while preserving context
5. **Grading Generation**: AI generates grades and feedback based on assignment criteria
6. **Professor Review**: Instructors can provide feedback to refine AI grading
7. **Result Delivery**: Grades and feedback are delivered via email or exported as PDF
