1. Mixed cadence + clause sprawl
Alternate short and long sentences; allow some long sentences to wander with extra clauses.

2. Asymmetric emphasis
Over-elaborate one point; compress or skate past another.

3. One aside
Add a quick parenthetical or em-dash remark — factual, not jokey.

4. Hedge twice
Use two mild uncertainty markers (“probably,” “seems,” “roughly,” “I think”).

5. Local disfluency
Keep one redundant or slightly awkward phrase that still makes sense.

6. Analogy injection
Insert a short, concrete comparison to something unrelated but illustrative.

7. Topic snap
Abruptly shift focus once, then return.

8. Friction detail
Drop in a small, seemingly unnecessary but real-world-plausible detail.

Structure & Cadence
Compression — light (−15%): Cut filler; merge short clauses; keep meaning.

Compression — medium (−30%): Trim hard; delete throat-clearing; tighten syntax.

Compression — heavy (−45%): Sever redundancies; collapse repeats; keep core claims.

DECREASE BY 50%: REDUCE THE LENGTH BY HALF WHILE PRESERVING MEANING 

INCREASE BY 150%: EXPAND THE TEXT TO 150% LONGER WITH ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND ELABORATION

Mixed cadence: Alternate 5–35-word sentences; no uniform rhythm.

Clause surgery: Reorder main/subordinate clauses in 30% of sentences.

Front-load claim: Put the main conclusion in sentence 1; support follows.

Back-load claim: Delay the conclusion to the final 2–3 sentences.

Seam/pivot: Drop smooth connectors once; abrupt turn is fine.

Framing & Inference
Imply one step: Omit an obvious inferential step; leave it implicit.

Conditional framing: Recast one key sentence as “If/Unless …, then …”.

Local contrast: Use “but/except/aside” once to mark a boundary—no new facts.

Scope check: Replace one absolute with a bounded form (“in cases like these”).

Diction & Tone
Deflate jargon: Swap nominalizations for verbs where safe (e.g., “utilization” → “use”).

Kill stock transitions: Delete “Moreover/Furthermore/In conclusion” everywhere.

Hedge once: Use exactly one: “probably/roughly/more or less.”

Drop intensifiers: Remove “very/clearly/obviously/significantly.”

Low-heat voice: Prefer plain verbs; avoid showy synonyms.

One aside: One short parenthetical or em-dash aside; keep it factual.

Concreteness & Benchmarks
Concrete benchmark: Replace one vague scale with a testable one (e.g., “enough to X”).

Swap generic example: If the source has an example, make it slightly more specific; else skip.

Metric nudge: Replace “more/better” with a minimal, source-safe comparator (“more than last case”).

Asymmetry & Focus
Asymmetric emphasis: Linger on the main claim; compress secondary points sharply.

Cull repeats: Delete duplicated sentences/ideas; keep the strongest instance.

Topic snap: Change focus abruptly once; no recap.

Formatting & Output Hygiene
No lists: Force continuous prose; remove bullets/numbering.

No meta: No prefaces, apologies, or “as requested” scaffolding.

Exact nouns: Replace vague pronouns where antecedent is ambiguous.

Quote once: If the source contains a strong phrase, quote it once; else skip.

Safety / Guardrails
Claim lock: Do not add examples, scenarios, or data not present in the source.

Entity lock: Keep names, counts, and attributions exactly as given.

Combo presets (one-liners)
Lean & Sharp: Compression-medium + mixed cadence + imply one step + kill stock transitions.

Analytic: Clause surgery + front-load claim + scope check + exact nouns + no lists.

I REPEAT: IT IS TO MADE CLEAR THAT OF ALL THE ABOVE PRESETS, 1-8 ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO LEAD TO SUCCESSFUL HUMANIZATIONS; THE OTHERS
ARE FOR STYLISTIC TWEEKS.
