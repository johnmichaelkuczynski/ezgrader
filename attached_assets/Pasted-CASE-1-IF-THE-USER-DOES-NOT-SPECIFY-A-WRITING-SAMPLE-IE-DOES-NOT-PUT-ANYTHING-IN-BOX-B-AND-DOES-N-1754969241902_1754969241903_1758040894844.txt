CASE 1: IF THE USER DOES NOT SPECIFY A WRITING SAMPLE (IE DOES NOT PUT ANYTHING IN BOX B) AND DOES NOT PROVIDE A CONTENT SAMPLE (IE DOES NOT PUT ANYTHING IN BOX C), THEN THE APP SHOULD USE "THE RAVEN PARADOX" AS THE DEFAULT STYLE SAMPLE; AND THE APP SHOULD TELL THE LLM TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX A SO THAT IT MATCHES THE STYLE OF THE RAVEN PARADOX SAMPLE. CASE 2: IF THE USER DOES NOT SPECIFY A WRITING SAMPLE (IE DOES NOT PUT ANYTHING IN BOX B)  AND DOES PROVIDE A CONTENT SAMPLE (IE HE PUTS SOMETHING IN BOX C), THEN THE APP SHOULD USE "THE RAVEN PARADOX" AS THE DEFAULT STYLE SAMPLE; AND THE APP SHOULD TELL THE LLM TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX A SO THAT IT MATCHES THE STYLE OF THE RAVEN PARADOX SAMPLE WHILE JUDICIOUSLY MIXING IN THE CONTENT OF BOX C TO ENRICH THE CONTENT OF THE REWRITE. CASE 3: IF THE USER PROVIDES A WRITING SAMPLE (IE HE PUTS SOMETHING IN BOX B) AND DOES NOT PROVIDE A CONTENT SAMPLE (IE DOES NOT PUT ANYTHING IN BOX C), THEN THE APP SHOULD USE THE CONTENT OF BOX B AS THE STYLE SAMPLE; AND THE APP SHOULD TELL THE LLM TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX A SO THAT IT MATCHES THE STYLE OF BOX B. CASE 4:  IF THE USER PROVIDES A WRITING SAMPLE (IE HE PUTS SOMETHING IN BOX B) AND HE PROVIDES A CONTENT SAMPLE (IE HE PUTS SOMETHING IN BOX C), THEN THE APP SHOULD USE THE CONTENT OF BOX B AS THE STYLE SAMPLE AND SHOULD ENRICH THE REWRITE WITH THE CONTENTS OF BOX C; AND THE APP SHOULD TELL THE LLM TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX A SO THAT IT MATCHES THE STYLE OF BOX B AND ALSO ENRICHES THE RESULT WITH THE CONTENT OF BOX C. AT NO POINT SHULD THE APP TELL THE LLM TO PRODUCE A 'HUMAN SOUNDING' REWRITE. AT NO POINT SHOULD THE LLM TELL THE APP TO PRODUCE 'THE BEST REWRITE POSSIBLE.' THE OBJECTIVE IS TO PRODUCE A REWRITE THAT IS A SURGICAL STYLE-CLONE OF THE STYLE SAMPLE. PERIOD. IF WHAT IS IN BOX A OR B OR C IS A PIECE OF SHIT, THAT IS IRRELEVANT; THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IS TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX AI IN SUCH A WAY THAT, AT A VERY VERY GRANULAR LEVEL, IT HAS THE SAME STYLE AS WHAT IS IN BOX B. WHEN I SAY 'GRANULAR LEVEL', I MEAN IN TERMS OF SENTENCE-LENGTH, SYNTAX (INCLUDING ODDITIES), DISTINCTIVE STYLISTIC SIGNATURES, SENTENCE-COMPLEXITY (E.G. A TENDENCY TO USE NESTED CONSTRUCTIONS OR A TENDENCE TO FOLLOW LONG SENTENCES WITH SHORT ONES OR EVEN WITH NOUN PHRASES THAT ARE ELLIPTICAL FOR SENTENCES). IF THERE IS TEXT IN BOX, THEN THE APP SHOULD ALSO (AS A SECONDARY DIRECTIVE) BORROW CONTENT FROM BOX TO ENRICH THE REWRITE. THE PURPOSE OF BOX C IS TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE LLM TO REWRITE WHAT IS IN BOX A IN SUCY A WAY THAT ITS STYLE MATCHES WHAT IS IN BOX B. THIS IS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE CONTENT OF BOX A MAY BY ITSELF BE INSUFFICIENT TO GENERATE A VIABLE CLONE OF THE CONTENT OF BOX B, AND IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS ADDITIONAL CONTENT (BOX C) IS NECESSARY.
