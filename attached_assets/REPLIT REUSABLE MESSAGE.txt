THIS IS NOT A FIX. THIS IS A GUESS.

Saying “should now work” is not a solution, it’s an evasion. This language suggests you:

Haven’t tested the exact case I reported

Haven’t confirmed that it works in a real user scenario

Haven’t validated it inside the app where the failure actually occurs

Your job is not to hope—it’s to verify.

What I expect from now on:
You test the failure in my environment (not a dummy project or internal clone).

You confirm the exact bug no longer occurs, using the same input I provided.

You paste the output/result, so I know it worked.

Until then, do not reply with “should work,” “try again,” or “we restarted the server.” That’s not a patch—it’s performative maintenance.

This is not QA theater. Either it works in my app or it’s still broken.
Do not close this until it verifiably works.
