A continuation of the earlier case will make it clear what this means and why it matters. Why doesn’t the outcome change under the given conditions? Because, says the standard account, the key factor remained in place. But, the skeptic will counter, perhaps we can discard that account; perhaps there’s an alternative that fits the observations equally well.

But, I would respond, even granting for argument’s sake that such an alternative exists, it doesn’t follow that it avoids more gaps than the one it replaces. It doesn’t follow that it is comparable from a trade-off standpoint to the original—that it reduces as many issues as the old view while introducing no more new ones.

In fact, the opposite often holds. Consider the alternative mentioned earlier. The cost of that account—meaning what new puzzles it creates—is vastly greater than its value—meaning what old puzzles it removes.

It would be difficult to devise an account inconsistent with the conventional one that, while still matching the relevant evidence, is equally efficient in explanatory terms. You can test this for yourself. If there is reason to think even one such account exists, it is not because it has ever been produced. That reason, if it exists, must be purely theoretical. And for reasons soon to be made clear, no such purely theoretical reason can justify accepting it.

But there is a further difficulty for this—or, by a similar line of thought, for any non-standard—replacement of the conventional view. It is not at all clear that, once the relevant details are considered, the replacement is even logically possible.

Taken on its own, a substitute account may describe a situation that seems coherent. It may not be contradictory in the strict sense. But that alone is not enough for it to serve as a viable model of the relevant information. Think of the range of underlying principles that would have to be set aside. Setting them aside, if possible at all, would create ripple effects. Consider the various interactions that would be altered, the balances disrupted, the exchanges prevented.

Those interactions do not only sustain the single feature in question. Removing them would have many other consequences—events unrelated to the specific aim of the new model. And there is no assurance that these other consequences would be compatible, even in a purely formal sense, with the data the new account is supposed to capture as well as the conventional one it seeks to replace.
