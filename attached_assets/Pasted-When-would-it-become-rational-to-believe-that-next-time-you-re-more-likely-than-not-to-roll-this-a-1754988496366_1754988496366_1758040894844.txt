When would it become rational to believe that, next time, you’re more likely than not to roll this as opposed to that number—that, for example, you’re especially likely to roll a 27? This belief becomes rational when, and only when, you have reason to believe that a 27-roll is favored by the structures involved in the game. And that belief, in its turn, is rational if you know that circumstances at all like the following obtain: 

*The dice are magnetically attracted to the 27-slot. 

*On any given occasion, you have an unconscious intention to roll a 27 (even though you have no conscious intention of doing this), and you’re such a talented dice-thrower that, if you can roll a 27 if it is your (subconscious) intention to do so.

*The 27-slot is much bigger than any of the other slots. In fact, it takes up so much space on the roulette wheel that the remaining spaces are too small for the ball to fit into them.

You are rational to believe that you’ll continue to roll 27s to the extent that your having thus far rolled multiple 27s in a row gives you reason to believe there to be some underlying structure favoring that outcome. And to the extent that a long run of 27-rolls doesn’t give you such a reason, you are irrational to believe that you’re any more (or any less) likely to roll a 27 than you are any other number. So, no matter how many consecutive 27s you roll, if you know with complete certainty that nothing about either yourself or the set-up of the game favors that outcome, it is irrational to think that, next time, you’re any more (or less) likely to roll
 
a 27 than you are a 5 or a 32. Put pedantically, it is only insofar as you have reason to believe in such a structure that you have reason to expect something that has the property of being a die thrown by you to have the property of landing in the 27-slot.
3.1.2 Generalizing these points
Your knowing of many phi’s that are psi’s and of none that are not doesn’t necessarily give you any reason to believe that the next phi you encounter will be a psi; it gives you such a reason only insofar as it gives you a reason to believe in some structure or mechanism that disposes phi’s to be psi’s. If you know on independent grounds that there is no such mechanism, no run of phi’s that are psi’s, no matter how long, gives you a reason to think that the next phi will be a psi; and you are guilty of the gambler’s fallacy—and thus, as we saw, of the most rank absurdity—so far as you think otherwise. Thus, in and of itself induction by enumeration is worthless; it’s a fallacious form of reasoning and falls in the same category as every other argumentative fallacy. Of course, if you know of many phi’s that are psi’s and of none that are not, you do have good reason to hold that, other things being equal, the next phi you encounter will be a psi. But this is because you’re having this knowledge gives you reason to believe there to be a principled or lawful connection between a thing’s being a phi, on the one hand, and its being a psi, on the other. Here, then, is the real structure of inferences that are wrongly thought of as cases if induction by enumeration: (i) you know of many phi’s that are psi’s and of no phi’s that are non-psi’s; (ii) on the basis of step (i), you believe there to be some principled connection between a thing’s being a phi and its being a psi; (iii) if you know of a given thing that is a phi, but don’t yet know whether or not it’s a psi, you know, given (ii), that it’s likely to be a psi; therefore, (iv) you conclude (if only tentatively) that it is a psi. 
Thus, any case of induction by enumeration that isn’t an instance of the gambler’s fallacy involves the positing some mechanism or law that, were it to exist, would explain a certain concomitance—it involves, in other words, a case of inference to the best explanation. The best explanation of the fact that all known phi’s are psi’s is that, thanks to some mechanism or, in any case, principled connection of some kind or other, a thing’s being a phi disposes it to be a psi; and as soon as such a mechanism has been posited, but not one second sooner, your knowing of a given thing that it’s a phi is a reason for you to hold that it’s a psi. So any non-fallacious “induction by enumeration” is nothing other than a case of inference to the best explanation (or, more precisely, is a case of applying some theory that embodies an inference to the best explanation).
Hume’s argument assumes that it is only through induction by enumeration that the past is any guide to the future. It assumes that, so far as we have any reason to believe that future phi’s will be psi’s, it is that past phi’s have been psi’s. But this assumption is dead wrong. The fact that past phi’s were psi’s, is not, in and of itself, reason to hold that future phi’s will be psi’s; it is such a reason only to the extent that it suggests some mechanism that disposes phi’s to be psi’s. Hume’s argument assumes otherwise and is thus guilty of assuming the legitimacy of the spurious form of inference involved in cases of the gambler’s fallacy. And, if it is to have a chance of going through, Hume’s argument must be so reconstructed that it no longer embodies that assumption.
