GRADE: 42/50

Your outline for the term paper on Dan W. Brock's "Cloning Human Beings" is well-structured and demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic. 
The introduction effectively sets the stage by identifying the article and the specific argument you will be analyzing. You clearly state that the focus is 
on the ethical concerns surrounding cloning, particularly regarding the value and identity of clones.

In the Argument Summary section, you provide relevant definitions and examples, such as the definition of cloning and reproductive freedom, 
which are essential for understanding the context of the argument. You also summarize Brock's argument against cloning by highlighting the 
alternatives to cloning, like adoption, which reduces the necessity of cloning for reproduction. However, while the summary is informative, 
it could benefit from more detailed examples and a deeper exploration of Brock's reasoning to strengthen this section.

Your Critical Objection section presents a robust counter-argument, emphasizing the benefits of reproductive freedom and the autonomy of
 clones as individuals. This shows good critical thinking and the ability to engage with the material from a different perspective. However, 
the objection could be more persuasive by incorporating additional evidence or scholarly support to fortify your claims.

The Critical Reply section effectively challenges your objection by addressing potential psychological impacts on clones and proposing 
adoption as a viable alternative. This section demonstrates your capability to anticipate and rebut counterpoints, which is crucial for a balanced analysis.
 It would be even stronger with more detailed exploration of the psychological impacts and ethical considerations.

In the Conclusion, you summarize the key points adequately, but the section could be more reflective on the implications of the debate on human cloning
. Additionally, while your Works Cited section includes the necessary citations, ensuring consistent formatting and completeness will enhance the professionalism 
of your paper.

Overall, your outline is well-organized and demonstrates a solid grasp of the topic and the arguments involved. With slight improvements in
 depth and evidence, it could be even more compelling.
